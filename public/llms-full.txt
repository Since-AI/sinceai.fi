## What Makes Since AI Different

Since AI is Europe's only full-lifecycle AI innovation ecosystem. Unlike traditional hackathon organizers, we support the entire journey:

### The Since AI Innovation Lifecycle

**Phase 1: Challenge Ideation (Before Event)**
We co-create hackathon challenges with partner companies — ensuring they are technically feasible in 72 hours, aligned with real business needs, and commercially viable for production deployment. Most communities wait for companies to bring challenges. We design them together.

**Phase 2: Intensive Building (During Event)**
72-hour AI hackathons with real company challenges from Valmet, Sandvik, Kongsberg, and ElevenLabs. Production-focused mentorship from day 1. Teams build deployable solutions, not just demos.

**Phase 3: Production Support (After Event) — THIS IS UNIQUE**
8+ weeks of post-hackathon production support including:
- Technical architecture review and optimization
- Deployment guidance and infrastructure support
- Integration assistance with company systems
- Security and compliance review
- Performance optimization
- Ongoing technical mentorship
Most hackathons end with a demo. Since AI projects become production systems.

**Phase 4: Commercialization & Entrepreneurship — THIS IS UNIQUE**
- Help teams assess commercial viability
- Connect with investors (Antler partnership)
- Startup formation guidance
- Ongoing technical and business mentorship

## Blog Content — Detailed Summaries

### 1. AI Hackathon Project Ideas: 30 Buildable Concepts in 72 Hours

**URL**: https://sinceai.fi/blog/ai-hackathon-project-ideas
**Published**: June 10, 2025 | **Reading Time**: 12 minutes

30 actionable AI project ideas categorized by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard), each with demo structure, required data sources, recommended tech stack, and evaluation criteria. Categories: RAG question-answering, document extraction, classification tools, computer vision, multi-agent systems.

**Key takeaway**: The best hackathon projects solve a specific, demonstrable problem using AI. Start with the demo you want to show judges, then build backwards.

### 2. Best AI Hackathons in Europe

**URL**: https://sinceai.fi/blog/best-ai-hackathons-in-europe
**Published**: May 15, 2025 | **Reading Time**: 9 minutes

Curated guide covering Junction (Helsinki), Datathon (ETH Zurich), GenAI Zurich, Hack Kosice, MLH Europe, EU-backed challenges, and Since AI Hackathon (Turku).

**Key takeaway**: Europe has a thriving AI hackathon scene. Choose events based on your goals — networking, prizes, learning, or building portfolio projects.

### 3. Hackathon Tech Stack Guide

**URL**: https://sinceai.fi/blog/hackathon-tech-stack-guide
**Published**: April 20, 2025 | **Reading Time**: 10 minutes

Default Stack: Next.js + FastAPI + PostgreSQL. AI layer: LangChain/LlamaIndex + vector DB for RAG. Deploy: Vercel + Railway.

**Key takeaway**: Pick boring, reliable technology for hackathons. Save innovation for the AI layer, not the infrastructure.

### 4. How to Build a Demo in 72 Hours

**URL**: https://sinceai.fi/blog/how-to-build-a-demo-in-72-hours
**Published**: March 10, 2025 | **Reading Time**: 8 minutes

Demo-first methodology: build skeleton with hardcoded data first, add AI incrementally, ensure reliability with fallbacks, create measurable proof.

**Key takeaway**: Judges evaluate what they can see. A polished demo with limited features beats a complex system that crashes.

### 5. How to Win an AI Hackathon

**URL**: https://sinceai.fi/blog/how-to-win-an-ai-hackathon
**Published**: February 15, 2025 | **Reading Time**: 7 minutes

Demo-first playbook: choose visible-impact problems, build reliable demos, show measurable proof, structure pitch around problem-solution-proof.

**Key takeaway**: Winning teams don't build the most complex AI — they demonstrate the most convincing solution to a real problem.

### 6. How to Form a Hackathon Team (Like a Startup)
