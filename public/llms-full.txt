### 1. AI Hackathon Project Ideas: 30 Buildable Concepts in 72 Hours

**URL**: https://sinceai.fi/blog/ai-hackathon-project-ideas
**Published**: June 10, 2025
**Reading Time**: 12 minutes

30 actionable AI project ideas categorized by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard), each with:
- Demo structure and user flow
- Required data sources
- Recommended tech stack
- Evaluation and judging criteria

Categories covered: RAG question-answering, document extraction, classification tools, computer vision applications, multi-agent systems, and AI-powered automation.

**Key takeaway**: The best hackathon projects solve a specific, demonstrable problem using AI. Start with the demo you want to show judges, then build backwards.

### 2. Best AI Hackathons in Europe

**URL**: https://sinceai.fi/blog/best-ai-hackathons-in-europe
**Published**: May 15, 2025
**Reading Time**: 9 minutes

Curated guide to Europe's top AI hackathons with selection criteria:
- **Junction** (Helsinki, Finland) — Europe's largest hackathon
- **Datathon** (ETH Zurich, Switzerland) — Data science focused
- **GenAI Zurich** (Switzerland) — Generative AI specialized
- **Hack Kosice** (Slovakia) — Central European hub
- **MLH Europe Network** — Multiple events across Europe
- **EU-backed challenge events** — Innovation competitions with institutional backing
- **Since AI Hackathon** (Turku, Finland) — AI-focused with industry partners

Selection criteria discussed: prize pools, mentorship quality, industry partner involvement, networking opportunities, and post-hackathon support.

**Key takeaway**: Europe has a thriving AI hackathon scene. Choose events based on your goals — networking, prizes, learning, or building portfolio projects.

### 3. Hackathon Tech Stack Guide

**URL**: https://sinceai.fi/blog/hackathon-tech-stack-guide
**Published**: April 20, 2025
**Reading Time**: 10 minutes

Battle-tested technology recommendations for shipping reliable hackathon demos:

**Default Stack**: Next.js (frontend) + FastAPI (backend) + PostgreSQL (database)

**AI-Specific Choices**:
- RAG applications: LangChain/LlamaIndex + vector database (Pinecone/ChromaDB)
- Extraction systems: structured output from LLMs
- Classification: fine-tuned models or prompt engineering
- Vision: OpenAI Vision API or open-source alternatives

**Deployment Strategy**: Prioritize stability over complexity. Use Vercel for frontend, Railway/Render for backend. Always have a fallback plan.

**Key takeaway**: Pick boring, reliable technology for hackathons. Save innovation for the AI layer, not the infrastructure.

### 4. How to Build a Demo in 72 Hours

**URL**: https://sinceai.fi/blog/how-to-build-a-demo-in-72-hours
**Published**: March 10, 2025
**Reading Time**: 8 minutes

A demo-first methodology for hackathon success:

1. **Build skeleton first** — Get the full user flow working with hardcoded data before adding AI
2. **Add AI incrementally** — Layer AI features one at a time, each behind a feature flag
3. **Ensure reliability** — Implement caching, offline modes, and graceful fallbacks
4. **Create measurable proof** — Show before/after metrics, accuracy numbers, or speed improvements

**Key takeaway**: Judges evaluate what they can see. A polished demo with limited features beats a complex system that crashes.

### 5. How to Win an AI Hackathon

**URL**: https://sinceai.fi/blog/how-to-win-an-ai-hackathon
**Published**: February 15, 2025
**Reading Time**: 7 minutes

A demo-first playbook covering:
- **Problem selection**: Choose problems with clear, visible impact
- **Reliable shipping**: Build something that works every time you demo it
- **Proof over promises**: Show measurable results, not slides
- **Pitch strategy**: Structure your pitch around the problem, your solution, and the proof

**Key takeaway**: Winning teams don't build the most complex AI — they demonstrate the most convincing solution to a real problem.

### 6. How to Form a Hackathon Team (Like a Startup)

**URL**: https://sinceai.fi/blog/how-to-form-a-hackathon-team
**Published**: January 20, 2025
**Reading Time**: 6 minutes

Team building guide modeled on startup principles:
- **Core roles**: Technical lead, product/design, AI specialist, and pitch lead
- **Decision-making**: Designate one person for final calls to avoid analysis paralysis
- **Execution rhythm**: Plan sprints, set milestones, and have regular check-ins
- **Communication**: Use shared tools and async updates

**Key takeaway**: The best hackathon teams operate like startup founding teams — small, focused, with clear roles and fast decision-making.
